## Notes

The original ESP32 Open SDK repository (https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk) has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained.
As a result we're no using a fork at https://github.com/someburner/esp-open-sdk to build the base open SDK.

For more information consult https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk/issues/387.
